# Is my friend cheating?

It happens that there are several possible (a, b). The function returns an empty array if no possible numbers are found which will prove that my friend has not told the truth! (Go: in this case return nil).

(See examples for each language in "RUN EXAMPLES")

## Examples:
```
removNb(26) should return [(15, 21), (21, 15)]
```
or
```
removNb(26) should return { {15, 21}, {21, 15} }
```
or
```
removeNb(26) should return [[15, 21], [21, 15]]
```
or
```
removNb(26) should return [ {15, 21}, {21, 15} ]
```
or

in C:
removNb(26) should return  **an array of pairs {{15, 21}{21, 15}}**
tested by way of strings.
